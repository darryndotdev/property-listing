# 🏡 Property listing project

A clean, responsive property listing interface with URL-based filtering, built using Next.js App Router, serverless API routes and dynamic client-side state synced with the browser URL.

## 🧰 Why I built this tool

I built this project to showcase how user input can drive dynamic, URL-based filtering, creating a responsive and performant interface. It’s a small but practical example of structuring features, managing state, and building interactive experiences in Next.js.

## ✨ Features

-   **Dynamic filtering** by country and superhost status
-   **URL-based search parameters** for shareable filters
-   **Fast API responses** via Next.js serverless routes
-   **Responsive UI** designed for modern devices
-   **Smooth filter updates** with no page refresh

### 🔜 Idea's to extend the project

-   Sort by price or rating
-   Map view of properties
-   Add to favourites / saved stays
-   UI refinements and micro-interactions
